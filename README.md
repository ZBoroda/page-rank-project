# page-rank-project
An implementation of the Page Rank Algorithm. I made this originaly for my applied linear algebra class, but made some modifications to improve performance. Uses the page rank algorithm displayed: http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-pagerank.

Uses the numpy and pandas libraries.
